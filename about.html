                <p>Hi! I'm Paul, a fullstack developer in Bristol</p>
                <p>After 10 years in language teaching I decided on a career change after having an idea for an a language learning app for my students. Self study led to me falling in love with coding and finding it was consuming more and more of my time, I
                decided to enroll at Mayden Academy to further my skills and pursue a career in my new passion, software development.</p>
                <p>I'm now looking for my first role with a company that has an ethical outlook where I can be challenged and grow as a developer. I'm excited about making a real world difference with my code.</p>
                <p>When I'm not coding I can be found tucking into a science fiction book or practising martial arts. Failing that I'll probably be practising my language skills or enjoying
                a pint of ale with friends and music.</p>
